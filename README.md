_**DEPRECATED: Use [Orno\Di](https://github.com/paulosborne/di) instead as the two are incredibly similar, and theirs is more actively developed.**_

The League\Di library provides a fast and powerful Dependency Injection Container for your application.

## Install

Via Composer

    {
        "require": {
            "league/di": ">=1.1"
        }
    }


## Usage

### Get a Container Object

    include 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $container = new League\Di\Container;

### Bind a concrete class to an interface

    $container->bind('\Foo\Bar\BazInterface', '\Foo\Bar\Baz');

### Automatic Dependency Resolution

The Di Container is able to recursively resolve objects and their dependencies by inspecting the type hints on an object's constructor.

    namespace Foo\Bar;

    class Baz
    {
      public function __construct(Qux $qux, Corge $corge)
      {
        $this->qux = $qux;
        $this->corge = $corge;
      }

      public function setQuux(Quux $quux)
      {
        $this->quux = $quux;
      }
    }

    $container->resolve('\Foo\Bar\Baz');

### Defining Arguments

Alternatively, you can specify what to inject into the class upon instantiation.

#### Define Constructor Args

    $container->bind('\Foo\Bar\Baz')->addArgs(array('\Foo\Bar\Quux', '\Foo\Bar\Corge'));

    $container->resolve('\Foo\Bar\Baz');

#### Define Methods to Call with Args

    $container->bind('\Foo\Bar\Baz')->withMethod('setQuux', array('\Foo\Bar\Quux'));

    $container->resolve('\Foo\Bar\Baz');

### Child Containers and Scope Resolution

A great feature of League\Di is it's ability to provide child containers with a separate resolution scope to that of it's parent container. If you bind a concrete class to an interface within one container, you can re-bind it in the child container, without fear of overwriting the original binding in the parent container.

#### Creating a Child Container

There are two ways to create a child container.

    $child = $continer->createChild();

    // OR

    $child = new Container($container);

#### Using a Child Container

The primary benefit of using child containers is scope-specific resolution.

    $container->bind('FooInterface', 'Foo');

    // Assuming class Bar has a FooInterface dependency.
    // This would use the Foo implementation.
    $bar = $container->resolve('Bar');

    // ...
    $child = $container->createChild();
    $child->bind('FooInterface', 'Baz');

    // And this would use the Baz implementation.
    $bar = $child->resolve('Bar');
